## Questions?
- How to handle 2-3-â€¦ word combinations?  *`find()` in the C++ library.*
- Forking really necessary? Or threads okay? *Threads are okay.*
- State machine by character to parse the messages? *Yes.*


## Teaching session

### Advice
- use one port per msg on the client side (recv)
- backlog: 10
- if sending failed (check first), send again
- use the header `Connection: close` and enforce it on HTTP 1.1!

- look at `Content-type: text` in the response msg before parsing
- only filter urls and text!
- if abusive content found, send 301, then new request for the error page, then forward

### Setup
- Set the browser to 127.0.0.1 + port number
- use port > 1024
- use only IPv4

### Architecture
Server | Client |
---|---|
get GET request + forward response to client | send GET to server + get response|
url filtering | content filtering|


## What needs to be done

#### Done
* Threads
* Server able to get requests
* Client able to get requests
* Client able to send request
* Client able to get response
* Constants file
* Constant content redirect response
* Exceptions
* Request as abstract object (get) with `to_string` method
* Response class with `to_string` method
* Separate TCP and Server files

#### Martin
* for the CHTTPRequest: method `string getHost()`
* for the CHTTResponse: method `string getContentType(const string& header)`
* for the CHTTResponse: method `bool isTextContent(const string& header)`
* parse the http: method, url, version, etc.

* replace `Connection: keep-alive` by `Connection: close` in the request

#### Lena
* Check for errors when the server uses the client

* Start report
